# Indonesia Area Data

Indonesia area data based on the _Permendagri No 137 Tahun 2017_ specification.
The areas are formatted into schema found in [https://github.com/edwardsamuel/Wilayah-Administratif-Indonesia](https://github.com/edwardsamuel/Wilayah-Administratif-Indonesia)

## Data Type

There are currently only 2 available format: **JSON** and **SQL**. Other formats should be easily derivable from those. 
> Note: The SQL file is generated to use in PostgreSQL. There's no guarantee it'll work elsewhere
